########################################################################################

This repository contains the scripts packages needed to execute the automated colony picking and bioassay associated with the publication titled "A biofoundry workflow for the identification of biosynthetic gene clusters associated with microbial growth inhibition" and instructions to import packages to execute them. 

The scripts were programmed using the Venus Three software (version 4.4.07740, Hamilton) and run on a Hamilton Microlab STAR plus (Hamilton, Bonaduz AG, Swizerland).

The detection and selection of colonies was enabled by the EasypickII software (Version 1.0.2, Hamilton).

Scripts for method, deck layout and libraries associated with colony picking are in package file “ColonyPicking.pkg” 

Scripts for method, deck layout and libraries associated with automated spore plating and bioassay are in package file “AutomatedSporePlatingAndBioaasay.pkg”.

The instruction to import/export the packages are on power point file titled "Import_Export Methods"
